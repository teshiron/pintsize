README.modules: required and optional Perl modules for flooterbuck.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

While mostly everything you need to run Infobot is already on your
system (providing, of course, that you have Perl 5.6 or newer 
installed), there are a number of flooterbuck features which require
modules that do not come with Perl.

There are a handful of ways to install modules. Ranging from most
straightforward to least straightforward:

1.  Ask your system administrator to make them available for you.

2a. Install them system-wide using Perl's module-management module,
    CPAN.pm. To install a module with CPAN.pm, issue a command like 
    this:

       perl -MCPAN -e 'install Module::Name'

    as the user who installed Perl. For more information on CPAN.pm, 
    type "perldoc CPAN" at your Unix prompt.

2b. Install them system-wide, in Windows, with your Perl distribution's
    package manager. Consult your distribution's documentation for
    details. 
    
3.  Install them by hand. Find the modules on CPAN, the Comprehensive
    Perl Archive Network, at <http://www.cpan.org/>, with help from
    CPAN Search at <http://search.cpan.org/>. For each module, obtain
    the file from CPAN, untar the package, and follow the instructions
    in the module's README.
